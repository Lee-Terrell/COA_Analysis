# Change of Address Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
Analyzing the Change of Address data from the USPS and using it as a proxy to see how/if migration patterns within the USA have changed over the years - mainly since COVID-19. A baseline was created from the 12 months leading up to Lockdown mandates (April '19 - March '20). The following three years after lockdown were compared to the baseline and simply broken up as follows: First year after lockdown (April '20 - March '21), second year after lockdown (April '21 - March '22), third year after lockdown (April '22 - Feb '23). A states `political lean` was also analyzed to see if it could be a potential influence of migration.
